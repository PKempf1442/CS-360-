CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming 


The application for this project was required to allow users to create an account and login. The app utilized a SQL lite database to store user inputs and return them in a grid format. The CRUD module communicated with the database allowing users to interact with the database. Lastly the app was required to prompt users for SMS permissions and check if they allowed them or not. 

 

There were only two necessary screens for this project, a login screen and a screen for users to input data and have it returned to them. The design was kept simplistic with minimal components on each screen.  

 

Throughout coding the app, I incrementally created and tested different modules of code. This development process streamlines the coding process by testing as you go giving you a functional whole once all the modules are completed. This process is certainly one I would continue with in the future.  

 

The testing for this app was relatively easy as the app was not extremely complex. The testing included functionality testing, ensuring components were working as intended and properly utilizing the user's data. The other tests that were done were to ensure users could only parse proper inputs and that the errors I implemented were properly catching improper inputs.  

 

The main challenge of developing this app from start to finish was the coding portion. It took a lot of research and tweaking to get the code base where I wanted it as I was completely unfamiliar with android studio before this project. Luckily my experience with Java translated well to the project, but the android specific commands took getting used to.  

 

I think the app I developed could use some improvement and the design itself could use some touching up. I think I made clear and concise code that functioned well and caught errors and in that I think I succeeded. Despite not being the greatest design, I think I executed it well.
